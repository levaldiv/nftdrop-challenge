# NFTDrop Challenge
How's it going everyone! This here is a Web3.0 NFT Challenge! We were tasked to create a website
that featured NFTs, styling, 3rd Web, and more. This was definitely a challeging BUT exciting build 
as it focused on what most Big Companies use today.

**NOTE:** This is all created using Thrid Web and the Rinkeby Test Network. THIS IS NOT REAL 
ETHEREUM. 

Here is a preview:
